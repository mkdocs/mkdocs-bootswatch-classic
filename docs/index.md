# MkDocs Bootstrap Theme

This project provides legacy [MkDocs] themes based on the 1.0.x version of the
`mkdocs` theme for the different Bootstrap 2 themes provided by the
[Bootswatch] project.


## Installation & Usage

installed MkDocs.

    pip install mkdocs-bootswatch-classic


After installation is complete, edit your [mkdocs.yml] config file and set the
[theme] to one of the following Bootwatch themes included. The full list is as
follows:

For example:
