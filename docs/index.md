# MkDocs Bootstrap Theme

This project provides legacy [MkDocs] themes based on the 1.0.x version of the
`mkdocs` theme for the different Bootstrap 2 themes provided by the
[Bootswatch] project.

## Installation & Usage

Install the collection of themes with pip, which is hopefully how you
installed MkDocs.

    pip install mkdocs-bootswatch-classic

After installation is complete, edit your [mkdocs.yml] config file and set the
[theme] to one of the following Bootwatch themes included. The full list is as
follows:

- [mkdocs-classic](#mkdocs)
- [amelia-classic](#amelia)
- [bootstrap-classic](#bootstrap)
- [cerulean-classic](#cerulean)
- [cosmo-classic](#cosmo)
- [cyborg-classic](#cyborg)

- [journal-classic](#journal)
- [readable-classic](#readable)
- [simplex-classic](#simplex)
- [slate-classic](#slate)
- [spacelab-classic](#spacelab)
- [united-classic](#united)
- [yeti-classic](#yeti)

For example:

    theme: amelia-classic

Or:

In addition, you can request an inverted navigation header:
